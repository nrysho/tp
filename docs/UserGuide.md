Bivago is a **desktop contact management app** meant for tour guides. Along with basic contact management, it also helps
you **efficiently look up contacts** associated with the different tour packages that you offer. The app supports
different types of contacts including **people, F&B establishments, accommodations and attractions**. Through
consolidating your contacts and tours in a simple **Command Line Interface (CLI)** application, Bivago helps you plan
and execute better and smoother tours for your clients.

## How it serves you

Bivago provides two main components:
* Contact Management
* Tour Management

### Contact Management
Through Contact Management, you can **store different types of contacts** you work with. You can store contacts for
people (e.g. drivers, shop owners), F&B establishments (e.g. street food vendors, restaurants), attractions (e.g.
museums, amusement parks) and accommodation (e.g. hotels, hostels). For each type of contact, they come with additional
 information relevant to that type such as Halal status, operating hours, and stars. Tags are also available for you
 to store any additional information.

### Tour Management
Through Tour Management, you can **store different tour packages** you offer and assign contacts with those tours.
When planning to conduct a specific tour, you can see the assigned contacts at a glance and with the relevant
information from the contacts, you can make informed decisions during tour planning. You can also benefit from tour
management while conducting the tour as you can quickly view contact details on the day itself and contact them.

## Quick start

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/releases).

3. Open a command terminal.<br>

---

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. the parameters `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER` and `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` are equivalent.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) 
  will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
* Parameters not specific to the contact type will cause the command to be rejected with an error message shown to 
  the user.<br>
  e.g. the parameter `h/HALAL_STATUS` is not applicable to a `type/person` contact, the add command will be rejected 
  until a correction is made.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

## General

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to use the application.

**Format:** `help`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

**Format:** `exit`

### Clearing the app : `clear`

Clears all data from the app.

**Format:** `clear`

### Undoing the last command: `undo`

Undoes the previous command.

* Commands which do not modify contacts/tours will not be considered
* There must be at least one command that modifies contacts/tours in the command history to be undone
* Multiple `undo` commands can be done in a row, as long as there are commands to undo

<details>
<summary><b>Example:</b></summary>

<ul>
  <li><code>delete 1</code> followed by <code>undo</code>:
  Restores the first contact that was deleted by the <code>delete</code> command.</li>

  <li><code>tour-add n/LeGoated Tour</code> followed by <code>list</code> followed by <code>undo</code> :
  Deletes the tour named <code>LeGoated Tour</code> from the tour list. Note that the <code>list</code> command was ignored by the <code>undo</code> command.</li>

  <li><code>delete 1</code> followed by <code>tour-delete 1</code> followed by <code>undo</code> followed by  <code>undo</code>:
  Restores the first contact and the first tour that was deleted by the <code>delete</code> command and the <code>tour-delete</code> command.</li>
</ul>

</details>

### Redoing an undone command: `redo`

Redoes what was undone by an `undo` command.

* Commands which do not modify contacts/tours will not be considered
* There must be at least one undone command in the command history to be redone
* Multiple `redo` commands can be done in a row, as long as there are commands to redo
* If a command which modifies contacts/tours is done after an `undo` command, the redo history will be cleared. This means that the undone command can no longer be redone.

<details>
<summary><b>Example:</b></summary>

<ul>
  <li><code>delete 1</code> followed by <code>undo</code> followed by <code>redo</code> :
  Deletes the first contact that was restored by the <code>undo</code> command.</li>

  <li><code>tour-add n/LeGoated Tour</code> followed by <code>list</code> followed by <code>undo</code> followed by <code>redo</code> :
  Restores the tour named <code>LeGoated Tour</code> that was deleted by the <code>undo</code> command. Note that the <code>list</code> command was ignored by the <code>redo</code> command.</li>

  <li><code>delete 1</code> followed by <code>undo</code> followed by <code>delete 2</code> followed by <code>redo</code> :
  Restores the first contact that was deleted by the <code>delete</code> command, then deletes the second contact. Note that the final <code>redo</code> command will result in an error, since the second <code>delete</code> command has erased the <code>undo</code> command from history.</li>
</ul>

</details>

### Saving the data

Bivago data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save
manually.

### Editing the data file

Bivago data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/bivago-data.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data by directly editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, or make certain values invalid, Bivago will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to make a backup of a file before editing it.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the
   application before running the application again.
