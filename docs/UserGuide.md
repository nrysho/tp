Bivago is a **desktop contact management app** meant for tour guides. Along with basic contact management, it also helps 
you **efficiently look up contacts** associated with the different tour packages that you offer. The app supports 
different types of contacts including **people, FnB establishments, accommodations and attractions**. Through 
consolidating your contacts and tours in a single application, Bivago helps you plan and execute better and smoother 
tours for your clients.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed 
[here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Bivago.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar Bivago.jar` command to 
run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will 
display the program usage instructions.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

* `help` : Displays the help message.

* `list` : Lists all contacts.

* `add type/person n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact
  named `John Doe` to the contact list.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will 
be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines 
as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains 
the data of your previous Bivago home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only 
the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the 
application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut
`F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to 
manually restore the minimized Help Window.
