# Introduction

Bivago is a **desktop contact management app** meant for tour guides. Along with basic contact management, it also helps
you **efficiently look up contacts** associated with the different tour packages that you offer. The app supports
different types of contacts including **people, F&B establishments, accommodations and attractions**. Through
consolidating your contacts and tours in a simple **Command Line Interface (CLI)** application, Bivago helps you plan
and execute better and smoother tours for your clients.

## How it serves you

Bivago provides two main components:

<panel header="Contact Management" type="seamless">
Through Contact Management, you can **store different types of contacts** you work with. You can store contacts for
people (e.g. drivers, shop owners), F&B establishments (e.g. street food vendors, restaurants), attractions (e.g.
museums, amusement parks) and accommodation (e.g. hotels, hostels). For each type of contact, they come with additional
 information relevant to that type such as Halal status, operating hours, and stars. Tags are also available for you
 to store any additional information.
</panel>

<panel header="Tour Management" type="seamless">
Through **Tour Management**, you can **store different tour packages** you offer and assign contacts with those tours.
When planning to conduct a specific tour, you can see the assigned contacts at a glance and with the relevant
information from the contacts, you can make informed decisions during tour planning. You can also benefit from tour
management while conducting the tour as you can quickly view contact details on the day itself and contact them.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) or
 parameters not specific to the contact type will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Saving the data

### Editing the data file

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
You are encouraged to make changes to the data using the commands provided by the app instead of manually editing the
 data file. If you make changes to the data file making its format invalid, Bivago will discard all data and start with
an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the Bivago to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of
 the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous Bivago home folder.

---

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the
   application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut
   `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to
   manually restore the minimized Help Window.
