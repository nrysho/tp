### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ContactListPanel`, `TourListPanel`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Contact` and `Tour` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a contact).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />
<img src="images/ModelClassDiagramContinued.png" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the contact/tour data i.e., all `Contact`/`Tour` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueContactList`/`UniqueTourList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Contact`/`Tour` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as separate _filtered_ lists which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Contact>`/`ObservableList<Tour>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
* validates each contact's type-specific fields on load — if a contact has fields irrelevant to its type (e.g. a `Person` with a `halalStatus` field), the entire data file is rejected and the app starts with an empty contact list.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Multiple Contact Types

Bivago's content management currently supports four main types of contacts, represented by the `Person`, `Fnb`,
`Attraction`, and `Accommodation` classes. An abstract class `Contact` serves as the parent of these classes. `Person`
serves as the most basic contact type that preserves the same structure as in the AB3 implementation. Classes
`HalalStatus`, `OpeningHour`, `ClosingHour`, and `AccommodationStars` serve as wrapper classes (similar to `Name`,
`Address`, `Phone`, etc.) for the type-specific fields of each type of contact.

<img src="images/ContactClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

The code in the `Logic` component is updated to reflect the additional fields of the different contact types.
`EditContactDescriptor`, a nested class within `EditCommand` that is used to make changes to contacts, has been
extended to include these additional fields.

<img src="images/EditContactDescriptorClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

### Tour Packages

Bivago's content management supports the creation of tour packages, represented by `Tour` class. Each `Tour` is 
uniquely identified by its `Name`. The class `TourFavouriteStatus` serves as a wrapper class for the boolean state 
of the tour.

<img src="images/TourClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

### Contact Favourites

Bivago also supports marking certain contacts as favourites, which is useful for managing important, commonly used,
or otherwise notable contacts. This is implemented using `FavouriteStatus`, a wrapper class containing a boolean value,
which is included in `Contact` as an additional field. New commands are introduced to manage favourites: adding contacts
to favourites, removing contacts from favourites, and viewing favourite contacts.

`FavouriteAddCommand` and `FavouriteRemoveCommand` perform a similar operation to `EditCommand`, making use of
`EditContactDescriptor` to change the `FavouriteStatus` of a `Contact`.

<img src="images/FavouriteAddSequenceDiagram.png" width="600" />

`FavouriteViewCommand` performs a similar operation to `FindCommand`, making use of a different predicate
`ContactIsFavouritePredicate` to filter only contacts whose `FavouriteStatus` is set to true.

<img src="images/FavouriteViewSequenceDiagram.png" width="600" />

### Tour Assignment Features

Bivago supports assigning and unassigning contacts to tour packages, as well as viewing all contacts assigned to a specific tour. These are implemented via three commands: `TourAssignCommand`, `TourUnassignCommand`, and `TourViewCommand`.

`TourAssignCommand` and `TourUnassignCommand` perform a similar operation to `EditCommand`, making use of `EditContactDescriptor` to update the set of `Tour` objects stored on a `Contact`. Both commands take two indices — a contact index and a tour index — resolve them against the currently displayed lists, validate the assignment state, then call `model.setContact()` followed by `model.commitAddressBook()` to persist the change.

<img src="images/TourAssignSequenceDiagram.png" width="600" />

<img src="images/TourUnassignSequenceDiagram.png" width="600" />

`TourViewCommand` performs a similar operation to `FindCommand`, making use of `ContactIsInTourPredicate` to filter the contact list to only those assigned to the specified tour. The tour index is resolved against the currently displayed tour list, consistent with how other commands treat displayed indices.

<img src="images/TourViewSequenceDiagram.png" width="600" />

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves a snapshot of the current address book state into its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th contact. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing a snapshot of the modified address book state to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add type/person n/David …​` to add a new contact. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another snapshot to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user decides that adding the contact was a mistake and executes `undo`. The `undo` command calls `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the left and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, there are no previous states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check for this case and returns an error to the user rather than attempting to undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `tour-delete 1`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book as a snapshot.
  * Pros: Simple to implement and reason about; every command automatically supports undo/redo without extra logic.
  * Cons: Higher memory usage as each snapshot is a full copy of the address book.

* **Alternative 2:** Each command knows how to undo/redo itself.
  * Pros: Lower memory usage (e.g. for `delete`, only the deleted contact needs to be saved).
  * Cons: Every command must implement its own undo/redo logic, increasing implementation complexity and risk of bugs.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty & Challenges

1. Understanding the existing AB3 architecture had to be done at the start to get a surface-level understanding.
2. Deepening our understanding of AB3 had to be continuously done throughout the development process, as we write code that affects other components.
3. Features could not be developed in isolation because changes to the model, parser, or storage components often had project-wide impact, requiring extra care.
4. Increased complexity from supporting multiple contact types (Person, F&B, Attraction, Accommodation), each with distinct fields and constraints, with the original AB3 handles a single entity type Person
5. Designing and maintaining a polymorphic model structure with the contact types introduced additional complexity in inheritance, validation, and storage.
6. Parsing logic became more complex as commands needed to handle type-specific fields while remaining consistent in format and behavior.
7. Testing effort increased significantly due to:
   - Multiple contact types with different fields
   - Edge cases for missing/invalid inputs for type-specific fields
   - Ensuring correct serialization and deserialization of different types

### Effort & Achievements

1. Implemented a contact management solution with multiple types as well as a tour management solution, significantly extending the scope beyond AB3’s original design.
2. Designed and integrated a favourites feature that works across contacts and tours, implemented as a field without interfering with existing logic.
3. Updated the design of the UI to meet our solution's needs (both contact and tour management), as well as to reflect contacts or tours assigned as favourites.
4. Identified and resolved bugs early through continuous testing and integration, reducing technical debt downstream.


## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

1. **Accept non-alphanumeric characters in names**: Currently, only alphanumeric characters are allowed to be entered in name fields. We plan to make the name field accept certain non-alphanumeric characters, including but not limited to `/`, `-`, `'`. This accounts for names which include `s/o`, `d/o`, and names such as `O'Brien`, `Jean-Pierre`.

2. **Accept non-English characters in names**: Currently, only alphanumeric characters are allowed to be entered in name fields. We plan to make the name field accept non-English characters, by accepting all Unicode characters classified as a letter. This accounts for names such as `Sergio Pérez`, `Nico Hülkenberg`.

3. **Enhance `find` command to search by any field**: Currently, the `find` command only supports searching by contact type and by name. We plan to make the `find` command more powerful by allowing users to search by any other field, such as email, phone number, address, halal status, opening/closing hours, and star rating.

4. **Enhance `find` command to match substrings**: Currently, the `find` command only matches against full words. We plan to make the `find` command more powerful by allowing users to specify whether to match against full words or match against substrings.

5. **Enhance email field validation**: Currently, the email field validation is on the more permissive side, as we do not want to reject unusual but valid emails. As such, some unusual but invalid emails might be accepted. We plan to improve the email validation to be closer to RFC compliant, so that invalid emails will be more likely to be caught.<br><br>
However, we would like to note that there are diminishing returns from strictly validating emails, and the foolproof method to validate emails is to actually send a test email.

6. **Accept duplicate names**: Currently, each contact is uniquely identified by its name. As such, users are not allowed to add a contact that shares a name with an existing contact, or edit a contact's name into one that is used by another existing contact.<br>
A workaround to this would be to add some additional text to the name, in order to disambiguate them. Some users may find this inconvenient, especially if they know a lot of people/entities with the same name.<br><br>
To remedy this, we plan to improve the flexibility of the app by identifying each contact using a combination of fields, such as name, phone, and email.

7. **Enhance phone number validation**: Currently, the validation for the phone number field is on the more permissive side, as we want to allow users to input additional information next to the phone number, or include the country code of the phone number. We also want to allow users to input multiple phone numbers in the same field. For example, we might expect the user to input `+65 6767 6767 (Office) | +65 9676 7676 (HP)`.<br><br>
However, this makes the parsing and validation of each phone number challenging, as it is difficult to anticipate how the user will format the phone numbers. We plan to strengthen the validation of phone numbers by restricting the format of the input field. For example, we may make the user specify 3 parameters for each phone number, which are the country code, the phone number itself, and additional remarks about the phone number.<br><br>
This stricter validation will limit the user to only be able to input one phone number per contact. We restore the ability to add multiple phone numbers per contact through the next planned enhancement.

8. **Allow multiple phone numbers in contacts**: Currently, we only provide a single phone number field per contact, which makes it difficult to validate phone number information. In order to support stronger validation, we plan to allow an arbitrary amount of phone number fields per contact. This can be implemented similarly to the tag system, where each contact can have multiple tags.<br><br>
By doing so, we can make the phone number data atomic for each contact, which in combination with the above planned enhancement, will give users the flexibility to add multiple phone numbers to each contact, while ensuring each phone number is properly validated.

9. **Record user preferences for window pane dividers**: Currently, the user preferences will record the overall window dimensions for the app. However, it will discard the changes the user made to the window pane dividers upon restart. For example, the user may have customised the dividers such that the console window pane and tour window pane are smaller.<br>
![CustomisedWindowPaneDividers](images/CustomisedWindowPaneDividers.png)<br>
However, when the user closes and opens the app, the dividers are reset to their default configuration.<br>
![DefaultWindowPaneDividers](images/DefaultWindowPaneDividers.png)<br>
We plan to make the app record the changes the user made to the dividers, and make these changes persistent across restarts.

10. **Indicate currently applied filters for contact and tour lists**: Currently, after using the `find`, `tour-find`, `tour-view`, `favourite-view`, `tour-favourite-view` commands which filters the view of the contact and tour lists, there is no indication that the lists were filtered. If the user wants to find out how the lists have been filtered, they will have to rely on their memory of the commands they last entered.<br><br>
To address this, we plan on adding an indicator which is always active, for each list, that tells the user what filters have been applied to the list. For example, if the last command which modified the contact list view was `find type/person`, the indicator would tell the user that the contact list is currently being filtered by `type/person`.
